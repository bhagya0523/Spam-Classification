 # Spam Classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) using Natural Language Processing techniques. The goal is to develop an accurate and reliable system that can effectively filter out unwanted or potentially harmful messages.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled emails, where each email is categorized as spam or ham. It is important to have a well-balanced and representative dataset for training the model effectively.

## Methods Used

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLP techniques are applied to extract meaningful features from the text content of emails.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines) are trained on the extracted features to classify emails.
