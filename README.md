# Spam Classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) using Natural Language Processing techniques. The goal is to develop an accurate and reliable system that can effectively filter out unwanted or potentially harmful messages.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled emails, where each email is categorized as spam or ham. It is important to have a well-balanced and representative dataset for training the model effectively.

## Methods Used

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLP techniques are applied to extract meaningful features from the text content of emails. This includes preprocessing steps such as lowercasing, tokenization, removal of special characters, stopword removal, and stemming to standardize and simplify the text data.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Various machine learning models are trained on the extracted features to classify emails. These models include Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and other classifiers suitable for text classification tasks.

## Project Description

This project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The email data undergoes preprocessing to clean and standardize the text content. This ensures that the machine learning model receives meaningful input features for classification.

2. **Feature Extraction:** NLP techniques are used to convert the text data into numerical feature vectors. This process involves transforming the text into a format that can be understood by machine learning algorithms, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.

3. **Model Training:** The preprocessed and feature-engineered data is used to train machine learning models. These models learn to classify emails as spam or ham based on the extracted features and labeled training data.

4. **Evaluation:** The performance of the trained models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This assessment helps determine the effectiveness of the classification system in accurately identifying spam emails while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

## Results

The trained machine learning model achieves (0.97) on the test dataset, demonstrating its capability to accurately classify emails as spam or ham. By leveraging NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms, the classification system provides an efficient solution for email filtering and spam detection.
